             Physics includes the study of practically every form of matter and how it interacts with other matter and with energy in various forms.

           <h4>Definition of Physics</h4>
           <p>What is physics? Physics is the branch of science that studies the physical world, including objects as small as subatomic particles and as large as galaxies.
             It studies the nature of matter and energy and how they interact.
              Physicists are inquisitive people who want to know the causes of what they see. 
              How does the moon move? Why does the moon move? Why do the stars shine?
               Why do your hands get warm when you rub them together? 
               Physicists, like all scientists, hope to find explanations that describe more than one 
               phenomenon and offer a better understanding of how the universe works.</p>
            <h4>Common Misconceptions</h4>
            <p>People commonly believe that physics is all about solving word problems and memorizing equations.
             While it is true that many physics classes focus on the equations
             it is important to remember that the purpose of physics is less about the problems and more about using equations, 
             laws, and theories to understand the world we live in.</p>
             <h4>Summary</h4>
             <ul>
                <li>Physics is the branch of science that studies matter and energy and how they interact.</li>
             </ul>
